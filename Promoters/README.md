# CpG sites identification as promoters or enhancers

**To replicate the analysis, you need to run the Promoters.R script, it already contains CpG sites identified for both LUAD & LUSC networks**

To better understand the analysis we have done for the identification of CpG sites we make available the files with the identification data through google drive. 

You can access the files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j9u8Pp0CNh0bYScgwm5vozKr2nzIZYPK?usp=sharing).
